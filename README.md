# Bulk Migrate Netlify Sites to Use the Focal Build Image

This is a small CLI to allow you to migrate all your sites to the Focal build image, which needs to be [updated by September 19](https://answers.netlify.com/t/please-read-end-of-support-for-trusty-build-image-everything-you-need-to-know/39004).

## Usage

This CLI makes multiple requests to the Netlify API, so it can take a few seconds to complete. Please be patient!

### First, check which sites are not running the Focal image on your account:

```bash
npx ntl-focal-migrate --list --account "Your Account Name"
```
### Don't know your account name? Run the following command. 
If you're signed into multiple teams, make sure to read the note at the next step. 

```bash
netlify status
```

### Next, update the build settings for your site with this command:

```bash
npx ntl-focal-migrate --update --account "Your Account Name"
```

> **Please note!** The `--account` flag takes the full account name string as it appears on app.netlify.com. Without this flag, all of your sites across all orgs will be updated. If you're only a member of one org, this is no problem. If you're in multiple orgs, make sure you don't accidentally change someone else's site settings by mistake!

### To do a few updates at a time, use the `--limit` flag

To make sure things are working as expected, you can batch update a few sites at a time by setting a `--limit` flag:

```bash
npx ntl-focal-migrate --update --account "Your Account Name" --limit 5
```

This will cause the CLI to update 5 sites at a time. This is useful if you want to verify that updated sites still build before changing everything.
